Developed a web app to showcase the solutions of a case study relating to finding the shortest paths to deliver products between distribution centers, application of e-commerce, and linearly assigning different services in a warehouse. The Branch and Bound algorithm in TSP is used to find the most cost-effective route to distribute products, Hungarian algorithm is used to determine the linear assignment of VAS in a warehouse.
